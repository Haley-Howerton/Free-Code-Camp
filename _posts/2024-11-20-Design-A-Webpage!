Learn Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) By Building a Cat Photo App

Sept. 23, 2024:

 HTML elements have an opening and closing tag with content in between.
 <openingtag>content </closingtag>
The h1 element is used for the main heading of a page
Only use one h1 element per page
h1-h6 signify the importance of the content within them. h1 is the most important and h6 is the least important
The p element creates a paragraph of text on the website
Commenting leaves messages that don't show up on the webpage.
It can also be used to make code inactive

NOTES: Day 1 went smoothly! I've done this section before but decided to start over and take notes to have a personal reference guide for my projects.

main element represents main content of an HTML document
Should be unique to the document and not repeated in other parts of the document
Oct. 7, 2024:

Nesting is putting one element inside another.
  Nested elements should be placed 2 spaces to the right of the element they're contained in.
<main>
  <h1>Most important content of the document</h1>
  <p>Some more important content...</p>
</main>
The img element adds images to a website. 
Img is a void element, meaning it has no closing tag
Attributes are words added to opening tags of an element to control the element's behavior.
Ex: Adding scr to an img element specifies an image's URL
<img src="www.URL" alt="image description">
Adding alt to an img element improves accessibility by providing a description if an image can't load
The anchor element (a) links to another page.
<a href="URL">link text to be displayed</a>
